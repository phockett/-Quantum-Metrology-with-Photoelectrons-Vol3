# 26/01/22, PH: quick tests with structure. Seems that (a) no repeated files allowed here; (b) all levels need a file, e.g. skipping a chapters file (but including sections) throws build errors.
# Otherwise HTML builds OK, PDF build seems to be missing part headers? (And intro header.) Might be formatting issue? Also has A LOT of custom Sphinx markup.
# TODO: check previous volumes for latex, and test with custom part pages.
#       test Latex content. Ah, try See https://jupyterbook.org/advanced/pdf.html#customize-latex-via-sphinx
