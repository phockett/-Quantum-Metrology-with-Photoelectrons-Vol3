  abstract = {Molecular frame high-harmonic spectra of aligned N2 molecules reveal a Cooper-like minimum. By deconvolving the laboratory frame alignment distribution, what was previously thought to be a maximum of emission along the molecular axis is found to be maxima at 35 degrees off axis, with a spectral minimum on axis. Both of these features are supported by photoionization calculations that underline the relationship between high-harmonic spectroscopy and photoionization measurements. The calculations reveal that the on axis spectral minimum is a Cooper-like minimum that arises from the destructive interference of the p and f partial wave contributions to high-harmonic photorecombination. Features such as Cooper minima and shape resonances are ubiquitous in molecular photoionization or recombination.},

Coupling the PImMS camera to an ultrafast pump-probe velocity-map imaging spectroscopy apparatus therefore provides a route to time-resolved multi-mass ion imaging, with both high count rates and large dynamic range, thus allowing for rapid measurements of complex photofragmentation dynamics. Furthermore, the use of vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths for the probe pulse allows for an enhanced observation window for the study of excited state molecular dynamics in small polyatomic molecules having relatively high ionization potentials. Herein, preliminary time-resolved multi-mass imaging results from C\$\_2\$F\$\_3\$I photolysis are presented. The experiments utilized femtosecond UV and VUV (160.8{$\sim$}nm and 267{$\sim$}nm) pump and probe laser pulses in order to demonstrate and explore this new time-resolved experimental ion imaging configuration. The data indicates the depth and power of this measurement modality, with a range of photofragments readily observed, and many indications of complex underlying wavepacket dynamics on the excited state(s) prepared.},

The images provide angle- and time-resolved data which, when obtained over a large time-window (900{$\sim$}ps), constitute a precision quantum beat spectroscopy measurement of the hyperfine state splittings. Additionally, analysis of the full photoelectron image stack provides a quantum beat imaging modality, in which the Fourier components of the photoelectron images correlated with specific beat components can be obtained. This may also permit the extraction of isotope-resolved photoelectron images in the frequency domain, in cases where nuclear spins (hence beat components) can be uniquely assigned to specific isotopes (as herein), and also provides phase information. The information content of both raw, and inverted, image stacks is investigated, suggesting the utility of the Fourier analysis methodology in cases where images cannot be inverted.},

The new experimental data include spin\textendash orbit and ligand-field-resolved partial cross sections, photoelectron angular distributions, branching fractions, and lifetime widths for the 4d-hole states. The spin\textendash orbit branching fractions and angular distributions are remarkably similar to the corresponding distributions from atomic Xe across a broad energy interval that includes both the intense shape resonance in the f continuum and a Cooper minimum in the same channel. The angular distributions and branching fractions are also in reasonably good agreement with our first-principles theoretical calculations on XeF2. Data are also presented on the lifetime widths of the substate-resolved 4d-hole states of XeF2. While the trends in the widths are similar to those in the earlier experimental and theoretical work, the linewidths are considerably smaller than in the previous measurements, which may require some reinterpretation of the decay mechanism. Finally, we present new data and an analysis of the Auger electron spectra for ionization above the 4d thresholds and resonant Auger spectra for several pre-edge features.},

Resonantly excited Auger spectra have been measured at photon energies coinciding with the Xe 3d5/2 \textrightarrow{} {$\sigma$}* and the overlapped Xe 3d3/2/F 1s \textrightarrow{} {$\sigma$}* excitations in XeF2. The non-resonant and resonantly excited spectra have enabled the Auger electron angular distributions, as characterized by the {$\beta$}A parameter, to be determined for the M45N45N45 transitions. In the photon energy range over which the Auger electron angular distributions were measured, theoretical results indicate that transitions into the {$\epsilon$}f continuum channel dominate the Xe 3d photoionization in XeF2. In this limit, the theoretical value of the atomic alignment parameter (A20) characterizing the core ionized state becomes constant. This theoretical value has been used to obtain the Auger electron intrinsic anisotropy parameters ({$\alpha$}2) from the {$\beta$}A parameters extracted from our non-resonant Auger spectra. For a particular Auger transition, the electron kinetic energy measured in the resonantly excited spectrum is higher than that in the directly ionized spectrum, due to the screening provided by the electron promoted into the {$\sigma$}* orbital. The interpretation of the F KVV Auger band in XeF2 has been discussed in relation to previously published one-site populations of the doubly charged ions (XeF22+). The experimental results show that the ionization energies of the doubly charged states predominantly populated in the decay of a vacancy in the F 1s orbital in XeF2 tend to be higher than those populated in the decay of a vacancy in the Xe 4d level in XeF2.},

The non-collinear geometry increases the phase-matching pressure, and results in a conversion efficiency of {$\sim$}10-3 from the 200 nm pump beam.

For oriented molecules, we measure the amplitude ratio of even to odd harmonics produced when intense light irradiates CO molecules and determine the degree of orientation and the phase difference of attosecond bursts using molecular frame ionization and recombination amplitudes. The sensitivity of the high harmonic spectrum to subtle phase differences in the emitted radiation makes it a detailed probe of polar molecules and will drive major advances in the theory of high harmonic generation.},

As with prior studies of MF reconstruction, the experimental side of this protocol is based upon time-resolved LF measurements in which a rotational wavepacket is prepared and probed as a function of time via photoionization, followed by a numerical reconstruction routine. In contrast to other methodologies, the protocol presented here does not require determination of the photoionization matrix elements, and consequently takes the relatively simple numerical form of a matrix equation. Significantly, this simplicity allows the successful reconstruction of MFPADs for nonlinear polyatomic molecules with D nh point group symmetry. We numerically demonstrate this scheme for two realistic molecular photoionization cases: N2 and C2H4. This new technique is expected to be generally applicable to a broad range of MF reconstruction problems involving photoionization of polyatomic molecules.},

  abstract = {Angle-resolved photoelectron spectra from rotationally selected A1Au state acetylene have been recorded using velocity-map imaging. Several Renner-Teller split vibrational bands have been observed and assigned, showing good agreement with previous zero kinetic energy photoelectron (ZEKE) work [S. T. Pratt, P. M. Dehmer, and J. L. Dehmer, J. Chem. Phys. 99, 6233 (1993); S.-J. Tang, Y.-C. Chou, J. J.-M. Lin, and Y.-C. Hsu, ibid. 125, 133201 (2006).] The extracted photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) corresponding to these bands show a strong dependence on the vibronic angular momentum projection quantum number K+. Subbands with odd K+ show PADs with maximum intensity along the polarization vector of the ionizing laser beam, while those with even K+ show PADs with maximum intensity perpendicular to this direction. Velocity-map images recorded at low photoelectron energies approach rotational resolution of the ion, and the evolution of the PADs with increasing rotational level prepared in the A1Au state indicates the potential of a "complete" determination of the photoionization dynamics of the A1Au state. This is further investigated in the following paper.},

  abstract = {The work presented in this thesis was carried out with the ultimate aim of learning about the photoionization dynamics of polyatomic molecules. This is a complex problem; in order to obtain sufficient experimental data to shed light on the dynamics careful measurement of photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) is required. Ideally these measurements are rotationally-resolved, and the angular distributions measured correspond to the formation of the molecular ion in a single rotational state. The ionization event, in the dipole approximation, can be completely described by the dipole matrix elements. If sufficient experimental data to determine the radial components of the matrix elements and associated phases, the dynamical parameters, can be obtained the photoionization experiment may be said to be complete. Analysis of such experiments requires that the initial state of the molecular system is also known, to this end resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI) schemes can be used in order to populate a single quantum state prior to ionization. The experiments presented here follow this methodology, with various REMPI schemes used to prepare (pump) and ionize (probe) the molecule under study, and the velocity-map imaging (VMI) technique used to (simultaneously) record the photoelectron spectra and angular distributions. Two molecules have been studied experimentally, acetylene (C2H2) and ammonia (NH3). In both cases dynamical parameters pertaining to the formation of specific states (vibronic or vibrational) of the molecular ion have been determined from experimental data. Additionally, in the ammonia work, rotationally-resolved photoelectron images were obtained.},

  abstract = {Chemical reactions are manifestations of the dynamics of molecular valence electrons and their couplings to atomic motions. Emerging methods in attosecond science can probe purely electronic dynamics in atomic and molecular systems [1,2,3,4,5,6]. By contrast, time-resolved structural-dynamics methods such as electron[7,8,9,10] or X-ray diffraction[11] and X-ray absorption[12] yield complementary information about the atomic motions. Time-resolved methods that are directly sensitive to both valence-electron dynamics and atomic motions include photoelectron spectroscopy[13,14,15] and high-harmonic generation[16,17]: in both cases, this sensitivity derives from the ionization-matrix element[18,19]. Here we demonstrate a time-resolved molecular-frame photoelectron-angular-distribution (TRMFPAD) method for imaging the purely valence-electron dynamics during a chemical reaction. Specifically, the TRMFPADs measured during the non-adiabatic photodissociation of carbon disulphide demonstrate how the purely electronic rearrangements of the valence electrons can be projected from inherently coupled electronic\textendash vibrational dynamics. Combined with ongoing efforts in molecular frame alignment[20] and orientation[21,22], TRMFPADs offer the promise of directly imaging valence-electron dynamics during molecular processes without involving the use of strong, highly perturbing laser fields[23].},

Here we present the experimental data from recent coincidence imaging experiments, undertaken with the aim of gaining insight into the complex ultrafast excited-state dynamics of 1,3-butadiene initiated by absorption of 200 nm light. We discuss photoion and photoelectron mappings of increasing dimensionality, and focus particularly on the time-resolved photoelectron angular distributions (TRPADs), expected to be a sensitive probe of the electronic evolution of the excited state and to provide significant information beyond the time-resolved photoelectron spectrum (TRPES). Complex temporal behaviour is observed in the TRPADs, revealing their sensitivity to the dynamics while also emphasising the difficulty of interpretation of these complex observables. From the experimental data some details of the wavepacket dynamics are discerned relatively directly, and we make some tentative comparisons with existing ab initio calculations in order to gain deeper insight into the experimental measurements; finally, we sketch out some considerations for taking this comparison further in order to bridge the gap between experiment and theory.},

Ionization occurs by a net three-photon absorption process, driven via the 4s\textrightarrow 4p resonance at the one-photon level. A theoretical treatment incorporating the intrapulse electronic dynamics allows for a full set of ionization matrix elements to be extracted from 2D imaging data. 3D PADs generated from the extracted matrix elements are also compared to experimental, tomographically reconstructed, 3D photoelectron distributions, providing a sensitive test of their validity. Finally, application of the determined matrix elements to ionization via more complex, polarization-shaped, pulses is demonstrated, illustrating the utility of this methodology towards detailed understanding of complex ionization control schemes and suggesting the utility of such ``multiplexed'' intrapulse processes as powerful tools for measurement.},

In order to obtain the maximum information from angle-resolved photoionization experiments it is desirable to record the full, three-dimensional (3D), photoelectron momentum distribution. Here we apply tomographic reconstruction techniques to obtain such 3D distributions from multiphoton ionization of potassium atoms, and fully analyze the energy and angular content of the 3D data. The PADs obtained as a function of energy indicate good agreement with previous 2D data and detailed analysis [Hockett et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 223001 (2014)] concerning the main spectral features, but also indicate unexpected symmetry breaking in certain regions of momentum space, thus revealing additional continuum interferences which cannot otherwise be observed. These observations reflect the presence of additional ionization pathways and, most generally, illustrate the power of maximum-information measurements of coherent observables for quantum metrology of complex systems.},

We absolutely refute this assertion and the spirit of the comment, although we do agree with Baykusheva \& W\$\textbackslash backslash\$"orner that the textbook theory is correct. In a short response, Response to Comment on "Time delays in molecular photoionization" [3], we have already provided a clear rebuttal of the comment, but gave no technical details. In this fuller response we extend those brief comments in the spirit of completeness and clarity, and provide three clear rebuttals to Baykusheva \& W\$\textbackslash backslash\$"orner based on (1) logical fallacy (category error), (2) theoretical details of the original article, (3) textural content of the original article. In particular, rebuttal (1) clearly and trivially points to the fact that there is no issue here whatsoever, with recourse to theoretical details barely required to demonstrate this, as outlined in the short version of our response. Our numerical results are correct and reproduce known physical phenomena, as discussed in the original article hence, as careful readers will recognise, the formalism used is canonical scattering theory, and cannot be anything other. In fact, there is no new fundamental physics here to dispute whatsoever, and nor was this the raison d'etre of the original article. Additionally, rebuttal (2) provides the opportunity to discuss, at length, some of these textbook aspects of photoionization theory, and we hope this discussion might be of service to new researchers entering this challenging field.},

  abstract = {Time-delays in the photoionization of molecules are investigated. As compared to atomic ionization, the time-delays expected from molecular ionization present a much richer phenomenon, with a strong spatial dependence due to the anisotropic nature of the molecular scattering potential. We investigate this from a scattering theory perspective, and make use of molecular photoionization calculations to examine this effect in representative homonuclear and hetronuclear diatomic molecules, nitrogen and carbon monoxide. We present energy and angle-resolved maps of the Wigner delay time for single-photon valence ionization, and discuss the possibilities for experimental measurements.},

In order to explore the characteristics and potentials of AR-RABBITT, a perturbative 2-photon model is developed; based on this model, example AR-RABBITT results are computed for model and real systems, for a range of RABBITT schemes.

  abstract = {Photoionization is an interferometric process, in which multiple paths can contribute to the final continuum photoelectron state. At the simplest level, interferences between different final angular momentum states are manifest in the energy and angle resolved photoelectron spectra: metrology schemes making use of these interferograms are thus phase-sensitive, and provide a powerful route to detailed understanding of photoionization. At a more complex level, such measurements can also provide a powerful probe for other processes of interest, for example: (a) dynamical process in time-resolved measurements, such as rotational, vibrational and electronic wavepackets, and (b) in order to understand and develop control schemes. In this talk recent work in this vein will be discussed, touching on ``complete'' photoionization studies of atoms and molecules with shaped laser pulses and XUV, metrology schemes using Angle-Resolved RABBIT, and molecular photoionization dynamics in the time-domain (Wigner delays).},

  abstract = {Pump-probe measurements aim to capture the motion of electrons and nuclei on their natural timescales (femtoseconds to attoseconds) as chemical and physical transformations take place, effectively making ``molecular movies'' with short light pulses. However, the quantum dynamics of interest are filtered by the coordinate-dependent matrix elements of the chosen experimental observable. Thus, it is only through a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical calculations that one can gain insight into the internal dynamics. Here, we report on a combination of structural (relativistic ultrafast electron diffraction, or UED) and spectroscopic (time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, or TRPES) measurements to follow the coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics involved in the internal conversion and photodissociation of the polyatomic molecule, diiodomethane (CH2I2). While UED directly probes the 3D nuclear dynamics, TRPES only serves as an indirect probe of nuclear dynamics via Franck-Condon factors, but it is sensitive to electronic energies and configurations, via Koopmans' correlations and photoelectron angular distributions. These two measurements are interpreted with trajectory surface hopping calculations, which are capable of simulating the observables for both measurements from the same dynamics calculations. The measurements highlight the nonlocal dynamics captured by different groups of trajectories in the calculations. For the first time, both UED and TRPES are combined with theory capable of calculating the observables in both cases, yielding a direct view of the structural and nonadiabatic dynamics involved.},

Using a previously derived mathematical formalism based on the density matrix, we are able to clarify the different aspects of molecular wavepacket dynamics that are observed in each beta parameter. As a general result, we find that rotational coherences are separated out from vibronic population dynamics by the highest order beta parameter. Data from linear, symmetric and asymmetric tops molecules is presented to demonstrate the validity of this interpretation. NSERC Discovery Grant.},

In this work, XUV photoionization of impulsively aligned molecular targets (N2) is used to provide a time-domain route to ``complete'' photoionization experiments, in which the rotational wave packet controls the geometric part of the photoionization interferometer. The data obtained is sufficient to determine the magnitudes and phases of the ionization matrix elements for all observed channels, and to reconstruct molecular frame interferograms from lab frame measurements. In principle, this methodology provides a time-domain route to complete photoionization experiments and the molecular frame, which is generally applicable to any molecule (no prerequisites), for all energies and ionization channels.},

Using covariance imaging analysis, a range of observed fragmentation pathways of the resulting polycations can be isolated and interrogated in detail at relatively high ion count rates ({$\sim$}12 ions shot-1). By incorporating the recently developed native frames analysis approach into the three-dimensional covariance imaging procedure, contributions from three-body concerted and sequential fragmentation mechanisms can be isolated. The angular distribution of the fragment ions is much more complex than in previously reported studies for triatomic polycations, and differs substantially between the two isomeric species. With support of simple simulations of the dissociation channels of interest, detailed physical insights into the fragmentation dynamics are obtained, including how the initial dissociation step in a sequential mechanism influences rovibrational dynamics in the metastable intermediate ion and how signatures of this nuclear motion manifest in the measured signals.},

Generally, the photoelectron momentum distribution is composed of a coherent sum of angular momentum components, each with an amplitude and phase. Here we show, by using photoionization of neon, that a train of attosecond pulses synchronized with an infrared laser field can be used to disentangle these angular momentum components. Two-color, two-photon ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-wave with a magnetic quantum number of zero. Interference of the f-wave with a spherically symmetric s-wave provides a holographic reference that enables phase-resolved imaging of the f-wave.},

In this pedagogical overview, a conceptual framework for time-resolved photoionization measurements is presented, together with discussion of relevant theory for the different aspects of TRPES. Simple models are used to illustrate the theory, and key concepts are further amplified by experimental examples. These examples are chosen to show the application of TRPES to the investigation of a range of problems in the excited state dynamics of molecules: from the simplest vibrational wavepacket on a single potential energy surface; to disentangling intrinsically coupled electronic and nuclear motions; to identifying the electronic character of the intermediate states involved in non-adiabatic dynamics by angle-resolved measurements in the molecular frame, the most complete measurement.},
