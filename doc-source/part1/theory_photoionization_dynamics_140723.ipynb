    "There are many flavours of this fundamental light-matter interaction, depending on system and coupling. For metrology, the focus is currently on the simplest case of single-photon absorption, in the weak field (or perturbative), dipolar regime, resulting in a single photoelectron. (For more discussion of various approximations in photoionzation, see Refs. {cite}`Seideman2002, Seideman2001`.) In this case the core physics is well defined, and tractable (albeit non-trivial), via the separation of matrix elements into radial (energy) and angular-momentum (geometric) terms pertaining to couplings between various elements of the problem; the retrieval of such matrix elements is then a well-defined problem in general, achieved by making use of the analytic geometric terms in combination with fitting methodologies for the unknown radial matrix elements, and this is the approach explored herein. Again, more extensive background and discussion can be found in {{ QM1 }}, and references therein. Note, however, that whilst the general approach taken here is sound, many outstanding questions remain regarding the information content required for such an approach to be successful, and if other limitations prevent a unique set of solutions to be found in a given case (e.g. symmetry restrictions, phase ambiguities) - such questions are explored further herein, particularly in the case studies presented {{ PARTII }}.\n",

Note, however, that non-perturbative (strong field) light-matter interactions are, typically, not amenable to description in a separable picture in this manner. In such cases the laser field, molecular and continuum properties are strongly coupled, and are typically treated numerically in a fully time-dependent manner (although some separation of terms may work in some cases, depending on the system and interaction(s) at hand).\n",
