To briefly (re)introduce these topics, and contextually frame the work discussed herein, some brief comments from {{ QM1 }} are reproduced below; the reader is referred to the introductory chapters of {{ QM1 }} for a lengthier treatment, and [an introductory video to *Phase-sensitive Photoelectron Metrology* can be found online](https://vimeo.com/223603377) (see also Refs. {cite}`hockett2017PhasesensitivePEM_DAMOP, hockett2018Bootstrapping_PQE, hockett2016PresentationsArchiveUltrafast` for further introductory presentation videos, materials and resources around the topic).\n",

    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "Quantum metrology can be loosely defined as any class of experiment which provides detailed information on quantum mechanical properties (phases, coherences, entanglement etc.) of a system. To stay with the spirit of modern metrology, this definition can further be refined to measurements which provide high-resolution quantum information; a clear contemporary example is therefore experimental methodologies which provide full quantum state reconstruction (e.g. quantum tomography), and/or make use of quantum mechanical properties as a tool for measurement (e.g. atom interferometry). Traditional high-resolution spectroscopies may also fit within this definition in some cases, although in the majority of cases high-resolution spectroscopic measurements provide transition line-strengths and energies, but lack sufficient information for a full determination or reconstruction of the underlying quantum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "\n",
    "...at what point does a measurement of a quantum mechanical system become quantum metrology? A pragmatic view on this is that the complete quantum state of the system must be capable of *unique definition from the experimental measurement(s)*. This is pragmatic in the sense that it leaves the door open for both *inferred* and *direct* reconstruction techniques. In the former case, the experimental data informs the theory and analysis, but is not directly ‘analysed’ or ‘inverted’ to provide or reconstruct the full quantum information; in the latter case one obtains the desired quantum mechanical information from the measurement in a more ‘direct’ fashion (which may, admittedly, still remain as a rather convoluted process, depending on the level of theoretical input required). Traditional spectroscopies again provide a touchstone here - high-resolution spectroscopy measurements can be compared with models or ab initio computations to provide quantum mechanical details of a system, but typically do not directly provide this information from a set of measurements alone. In this sense they fit a pragmatic definition of quantum metrology, but not a more specific definition of quantum metrology as a (somewhat) direct empirical technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while quantum metrology can come in many flavours, at heart it might be considered as any set of measurements (and associated analysis methodologies) which provide detailed (quantitative) quantum mechanical information on a given system of interest - ideally with little or no restriction on the complexity of the system - and it is discussed in this spirit herein.\n",

    "And, for the specific case of photoionization...\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "... both *ab initio* methods and *high-dimensionality measurements* (combined with detailed *analysis methodologies*) can nonetheless provide detailed information on the photoionization dynamics. Although the simple analogy with Young’s double-slit [i.e. basic two-path interferometry] fails, the resulting photoelectron flux, measured spatially, remains, in essence, a self-referencing angular interferogram of the continuum wavefunction. In a more abstract sense, the basic interferometer paradigm can be extended to the general ‘photoionization interferometer’, one just has to keep in mind that there are now potentially many, many channels. In the most basic sense, the energy and angle resolved interferograms - the photoelectron flux as a function of energy and angle $I(E,\\theta,\\phi)$ - which may be measured, are nothing more than an interferometric measurement sensitive to the relative phases of the different angular momentum components.\n",
    "\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the photoionization community, the angular interferograms (which will usually be considered at a single energy $E$) are photoelectron angular distributions ({term}`PADs`), and have long been used as a means to learn about the process of photoionization. In this context, {term}`PADs` measured for a range of experimental parameters can provide a dataset with sufficient information content to determine the magnitudes and phases of the photoelectron wavefunction, hence the photoionization dynamics may be reconstructed from the measurements in favourable cases. This class of measurement is traditionally termed a *complete photoionization experiment*, although the exact nature of the completeness may vary. The phase-sensitivity of photoelectron interferograms have also been used in complementary fashions in other contexts, including as a means to probe the phase-shift induced by a specific prepared pathway, and control in multipath schemes, and in many other regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "\n",
    "... the combination of a phase-sensitive quantum mechanical observable - photoelectron interferograms - with modern experimental and computational techniques provides the tools required for a full quantum metrology based on this class of measurement. Following the above discussion and definitions, a full metrology technique is one which allows both the *intrinsic* and *extrinsic/dynamic* quantum mechanical properties of the system under study to be obtained/reconstructed from a measurement, or set of measurements. In the simplest case, one might seek to understand just the intrinsic photoionization dynamics of a scattering system (e.g. the magnitudes and phases of the various pathways [...]), while in more complex cases the intrinsic properties are part of a probe process for additional properties or dynamics of the system [...]. In all cases, the key is measurement (and possibly control) with a high information-content technique, and a detailed understanding of the processes involved.\n",

    "### Generalised geometric metrology protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to develop a quantitative form of photoelectron spectroscopy, hence analyse photoelectron interferograms in the context of quantum metrology in general, a number of techniques have previously been investigated (see {{ QM12 }}). In general, any applicable technique involves the manipulation or control of parameters which affect the observables in analytically-defined (or otherwise well-characterised) ways; measurements over a set of suitable experimental or control parameters then provide the high information-content dataset required for a full characterisation of the system at hand. Typically, \"geometric\" (angular-momentum) properties of the system provide a suitable set of control parameters, and a number of experimental methodologies with different flavours of these parameters have been demonstrated (see {{ QM2 }}). The main, outstanding, issue with previous techniques was the system-specific nature of many of the applications: ideally, one would like to make use of a generalised protocol, which is independent of the particulars of the system under study, hence does not require, for example, specific spectroscopic properties to be known and/or be experimentally accessible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of the work in the current volume is the further development, deployment and demonstrations of, such a scheme. The focus is on one specific *high information-content* technique: the *generalised bootstrapping* protocol, which makes use of experiments using rotational wavepackets as a (geometric) control dimension, and time-resolved photoelectron measurements as a high-dimensionality, phase-sensitive observable; the combination of these measurements with a quantitative analysis methodology provides a (relatively) general route to a full quantum metrology with photoelectrons (a.k.a. complete photoionization experiments, a.k.a. quantum state reconstruction/quantum tomography). A brief introduction to the technique is given below, with theoretical and numerical techniques and demonstrations forming the remainder of this book; interested readers can find a longer topical introduction in {{ QM2 }} (in particular Chpt. 11), and see also Ref. {cite}`marceau2017MolecularFrameReconstruction` for an experimental demonstration, and Refs. {cite}`hockett2022TopicalReviewMFpreprint,hockett2023TopicalReviewExtracting` for a recent review in the context of molecular frame reconstruction.\n",

    "For the analysis of the data [time-resolved photoelectron images from a rotationally-excited system], a ‘bootstrapping’ fitting approach was developed. This methodology [... is illustrated conceptually in {numref}`fig-bootstrap-concept-outline`, and outlined in more detail in {numref}`fig-bootstrap-fitting-diag` ...] is comprised of two stages (potentially split into multiple steps) which allow for the separation of the two sets of unknowns (rotational and ionization dynamics), and provides a way to gradually bootstrap to the complete {term}`MF` results via stages of analysis of increasing complexity. The nature of the fitting at each stage also provides a flexible methodology which can be used to carefully sample the solution hyperspace in order to ensure unique results, and fit with variable information content (experimental measurements) based on computational time and desired precision, based on a similar Monte-Carlo sampling manner to the methodologies already discussed [...]. In all cases, the underlying physics provides stringent limits on the form of the fitting functions, hence the fitting procedure at each stage is expected to be somewhat reliable by construction. Further analysis of the results, including comparison with experimental parameters, additional data not used in the analysis, and *ab initio* calculations all provide additional means of cross-checking and verifying the extracted physical parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of information content, the bootstrapping procedure gradually increases both the experimental information content - the number of geometric configurations of the photoionization interferometer - and the level of physical information included (hence fitted/extracted) in the analysis. In the first step, {term}`ADMs` [i.e. molecular alignment properties] are determined without the need for accurate treatment of the ionization probe {cite}`Makhija2016a`; in the second step this information is used as part of the calculation to determine the ionization dynamics. In the sub-steps to determine the ionization dynamics, the experimental information content included in the analysis is gradually increased: the initial coarse steps in this procedure provide a base-line high information content, without the necessity for many temporal points, via the selection of highly distinct molecular axis distributions, while latter sub-steps allow for fine-tuning of the data by gradually coupling additional time-steps [or other constraints] into the analysis.\n",

The exact nature of the wavepacket is laser pulse(s) and system dependent, but the technique is general. \n",
    "2. Time-resolved photoelectron measurements. Experimentally, this requires - at minumum - a pump-probe type configuration, with the alignment pulse as the pump, and a time-delayed ionization pulse. This is a typical experimental configuration in many ultrafast laser labs, with pulses typically in the atto- or femto-second regime. Measurements may be made by any angle-resolved technique; photoelectron imaging (via velocity-map imaging, {term}`VMI`) is currently the most accessible and widespread method.\n",

The Open Science movement, in part, aims to challenge these issues - see, for further discussion, Refs. {cite}`Barnes2010, mcnutt2016TakingTOP, Nosek2015, StateOpenData2016, Stodden2014, Downs2015, howison2015UnderstandingScientificSoftware`, or the [Wikipeadia Open Science page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) for a brief summary {cite}`wikipeadiaOpenScience`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, this book is fully open-source, including the full book source code, the computational libraries used and the datasets illustrated herein, and available via {{ book_repo }}; this is detailed further in {numref}`Sect. %s <chpt:platformIntro>`. In order to aid portability and reproducibility, Docker builds are also available: these provide a means to define a full computational platform/stack, from the OS level and up, including all necessary dependencies and version; further details can be found in {numref}`Sect. %s <sect:platform:docker>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is hoped that making such tools more accessible, usable, and interconnected - as well as making computational data generally available - will lower the barrier to entry to the field and create a useful foundation for interested researchers to work from."
