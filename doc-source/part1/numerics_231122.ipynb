    "## Fitting methodologies\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the extraction of parameters from a data set can be viewed as a general minimization (fitting) problem. This type of treatment is versatile, and can be multi-stage depending on the complexity of the problem. For the generalised bootstrapping method, the treatment of photoionization data is split into two types of fit, as shown in {numref}`fig-bootstrap-fitting-diag`. Firstly, a linear fitting stage to retrieve the molecular axis distribution, characterised by a set of {{ ADMs }} (see {numref}`Sect. %s <sec:theory:AF-alignment-term>` for details); secondly, a non-linear fitting stage to retrieve the complex-valued matrix elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the data, the 1st stage can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{\\beta}_{L,M}^{u}(\\epsilon,t)=\\sum_{K,Q,S}A_{Q,S}^{K}(t)\\bar{C}_{KQS}^{LM}(\\epsilon)\n",
    "$$ (eqn:beta-convolution-C)\n",
    "\n",
    "And the 2nd stage as per Eqs. {eq}`eqn:channel-fns` and {eq}`eq:BLM-tensor-AF` for the AF case:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{\\beta}_{L,M}^{u}(\\epsilon,t)=\\sum_{\\zeta,\\zeta'}\\bar{\\varUpsilon_{}}_{L,M}^{u,\\zeta\\zeta'}(t)\\mathbb{I}^{\\zeta\\zeta'}(\\epsilon)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In these forms, the terms are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $A_{Q,S}^{K}(t)$, the set of {{ ADMs }} defining the molecular alignment, and associated parameters $\\bar{C}_{KQS}^{LM}(\\epsilon)$.\n",
    "2. $\\bar{\\varUpsilon_{}}_{L,M}^{u,\\zeta\\zeta'}(t)$, the channel functions in the {{ AF }} (Eq. {eq}`eq:BLM-tensor-AF`, and matrix elements $\\mathbb{I}^{\\zeta\\zeta'}(\\epsilon)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence stage (2) relies on the inputs of stage (1), i.e. the {{ ADMs }}; and the parameters in stage (1) can be determined via fitting the data (linear regression) making use of computed sets of $A_{Q,S}^{K}(t)$ as a function of experimental parameters (laser fluence and rotational temperature). In this case, a range of {{ ADMs }} \"basis sets\" are computed, and the best match to the experimental data chosen - more details are discussed in Sect. XX. In a similar manner, the 2nd stage makes use of a known basis set - the channel functions - but a non-linear fit is required to determine the set of matrix elements, see Sect. XX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is also of note that, although the case herein focusses on rotational wavepackets as a control parameter, the same general approach can be applied to other cases, e.g. fitting {{ MF }} {{ PADs }} directly (for which only the 2nd stage is required), fitting {{ PADs }} obtained via rotational state-resolved transitions, with shaped laser pulses and so on, as detailed in {{ QM12 }}. Although only rotational wavepacket cases are illustrated in this work (see {numref}`Chpt. %s <chpt:extracting-matrix-elements-overview>`), by suitable choice of dataset and channel functions many other experimental schemes may be modelled and analysed; the {{ PEMtk_repo }} is designed with  this flexibility in mind."

A significant outcome of these studies has been the development of a reliable model capable of accurate simulations of rotational wavepacket dynamics that quantitatively agree with experimental results [REFS]. By measurement of a signal from a time evolving rotational wavepacket, this ability to accurately simulate the wavepacket dynamics can be used to reconstruct the measured signal in the molecular frame. Since in this case the time resolved measurement constitutes a set of measurements of the same quantity from a variety of molecular axes distributions, it is reasonable to conclude that if the axes distributions are known, and provided a large enough space of orientations is explored by the molecule over the experimental time window, the molecular frame signal should be extractable. \n",

Optimally, the corresponding physical properties can be cross-checked with other experimental estimates for additional confirmation of the fidelity of the protocol, although this may not always be possible.
