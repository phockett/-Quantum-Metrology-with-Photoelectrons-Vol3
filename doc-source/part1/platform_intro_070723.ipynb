    "In recent years, a unified Python codebase/ecosystem/platform has been in development to tackle various aspects of photoionization problems, including *ab initio* computations and experimental data handling, and (generalised) matrix element retrieval methods. The eponymous _Quantum Metrology with Photoelectrons_ platform is introduced here, and is used for the analysis herein. The main aim of the platform is to provide a unifying data layer, and analysis routines, for photoelectron metrology, including new methods and tools, as well as a unifying bridge between these and existing tools. {numref}`qm-platform-diag` provides a general overview of some of the main tools and tasks/layers.\n",

    "The core analysis tools, which constitute the {{ PEMtk_repo }} platform, are themselves built with the aid of a range of open-source python packages/libraries which handle various backend functionality. Notably, they make use of the following key packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* General functionality makes use of the usual \"Scientific Python\" stack, in particular: \n",
    "   * [`Numpy`](https://numpy.org/) {cite}`NumPy` for general numerical methods and data types.\n",
    "   * [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) {cite}`PandasPythonData` for statistical methods, and various tabulation and sorting tasks.\n",
    "   * [`Scipy`](https://scipy.org/) {cite}`SciPy` for some special functions and computational routines, particularly spherical harmonics and fitting routines (see below).\n",
    "* General tensor handling and manipulation makes use of the [Xarray library](https://docs.xarray.dev) {cite}`hoyer2017XarrayNDLabeled,XarrayDocumentation`.\n",
    "* Angular momentum functions\n",
    "    * Wigner D and 3js are currently implemented directly, or via the [Spherical Functions library](https://github.com/moble/spherical_functions) {cite}`boyle2022SphericalFunctionsGithub, boyle2023MobleSphericalFunctions`, and have been tested for consistency with the definitions in Zare (for details see [the ePSproc docs](https://epsproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tests/Spherical_function_testing_Aug_2019.html) {cite}`ePSprocDocs`). The Spherical Functions library also uses [`quaternion`](https://github.com/moble/quaternion) {cite}`boyle2023MobleQuaternionRelease, MobleQuaternionGithub` which implements a quaternion datatype in Numpy.\n",
    "    * Spherical harmonics are defined with the usual physics conventions: orthonormalised, and including the Condon-Shortley phase. Numerically they are implemented directly or via SciPy's `sph_harm` function (see [the SciPy docs for details](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.sph_harm.html) {cite}`SciPyDocumentation`. Further manipulation and conversion between different normalisations can be readily implemented with the [pyshtools library](https://shtools.github.io/SHTOOLS/) {cite}`SHtoolsGithub, wieczorek2018SHToolsToolsWorking, wieczorek2019SHTOOLSSHTOOLSVersion, wieczorek2022SHtoolsDocs`. See {numref}`Sect. %s <sec:theory:sph-harm-intro>` for examples.\n",
    "    * Symmetry functionality, specifically computing symmetrized harmonics $X_{hl}^{\\Gamma\\mu*}(\\theta,\\phi)$ (see Eq. {eq}`eq:AF-PAD-general`), makes use of `libmsym` {cite}`johansson2017AutomaticProcedureGeneratinga, johansson2022LibmsymGithub` (symmetry coefficients) and `SHtools` {cite}`wieczorek2018SHToolsToolsWorking,SHtoolsGithub` (general spherical harmonic handling and conversion).  See {numref}`Sect. %s <sec:theory:sym-harm-into>` for examples.\n",

In this work only the Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization method has been used, which wraps [Scipy's `least_squares` functionality](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html) {cite}`SciPyDocumentation`, hence this is the core numerical minimization routine for the demonstration cases herein. (See {numref}`Chapter %s <chpt:numerical-details>` for further discussion of fitting methods.)\n",
    "    * Basic parallelization for fitting routines is implemented using the [`xyzpy`](https://xyzpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library {cite}`XyzpyDocumentation`, see {numref}`Chapter %s <sect:basic-fit-setup>` for further details.\n",

    "    * [`Holoviews`](https://holoviews.org/) {cite}`HoloViewsDocumentation`: used for data handling and interactive plotting, Holoviews is a general plotting tool which wraps various backends; [`hvplot`](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) {cite}`HvPlotDocumentation` can also be used to provide additional `Pandas` and `Xarray` integration for Holoviews. Most of the plots herein use Holoviews. \n",
    "    * [`Bokeh`](https://bokeh.org/) {cite}`Bokeh`: used for interactive plots, implemented in the {{ PEMtk_repo }} via Holoviews wrappers/methods.\n",
    "    * [`Plotly`](https://plotly.com/) {cite}`Plotly`: used in the the {{ PEMtk_repo }} and the {{ ePSproc_full }} for spherical polar plotting routines.\n",
    "    * [`Seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) {cite}`SeabornDocumentation, waskom2021SeabornStatisticalData`: used for statistical methods and some specialist plots and styles, particularly the [`lmPlot` routine](https://epsproc.readthedocs.io/en/dev/demos/ePSproc_demo_matE_plotting_Feb2020.html#Plotting-maps-with-lmPlot) in {{ ePSproc_full }}.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some specialist (optional) tools also make use of additional libraries, although these are not required for basic use; in particular:\n",
    "   * For 3D orbital visualizations with {{ ePSproc_repo }}: [pyvista](https://docs.pyvista.org/) for 3D plotting (which itself is built on VTK), [cclib](https://cclib.github.io/) for electronic structure file handling and conversion, and methods based on [Chemlab](https://chemlab.readthedocs.io) for molecule wavefunction (orbital) computation from electronic structure files are all used on the backend.\n",
    "   * [`Numba`](https://numba.pydata.org/) {cite}`NumbaHighPerformance` is used for numerical acceleration in some routines, although remains mainly experimental in `ePSproc` at the time of writing (an exception to this is the Spherical Functions library, which does make full use of Numba acceleration).\n",
