    "In recent years, a unified Python codebase/ecosystem/platform has been in development to tackle various aspects of photoionization problems, including *ab initio* computations and experimental data handling, and (generalised) matrix element retrieval methods. The eponymous _Quantum Metrology with Photoelectrons_ platform is introduced here, and is used for the analysis herein. The main aim of the platform is to provide a unifying data platform, and analysis routines, for photoelectron metrology, including new methods and tools, as well as a unifying bridge between these and existing tools. {numref}`qm-platform-diag` provides a general overview of some of the main tools and tasks/layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of late 2022, the new parts of the platform - primarily the {{ PEMtk_repo }} library - implement general data handling (although not a full experimental analysis toolchain), matrix element handling and retrieval, which will be the main topic of this volume.\n",
    "In the future, it is hoped that the platform will be extended to other theoretical and experimental methods, including full experimental data handling.\n",

    "-   The {{ PEMtk_repo }} (PEMtk) codebase aims to provide various general data handling routines for photoionization problems. At the time of writing, simulation of observables and fitting routines are implemented, along with some basic utility functions.\n",
    "    Much of this is detailed herein, and more technical details and ongoing documentation case be found in the {{ PEMtk_docs }}.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The {{ ePSproc_full }} aims to provide methods for post-processing with *ab initio* radial dipole matrix\n",
    "    elements from {{ ePS_full }}, or equivalent matrix elements from other sources (dedicated support for R-matrix results from [the RMT suite](https://gitlab.com/Uk-amor/RMT/rmt) {cite}`brown2020RMTRmatrixTimedependence,RmatrixRepo` is in development, for an overview of *ab initio* methods/packages see Ref. {cite}`dowek2022TrendsAngleresolvedMolecular`). \n",
    "    The core functionality includes the computation of AF and MF observables. Manual computation without known matrix elements is also possible, e.g. for investigating\n",
    "    limiting cases, or data analysis and fitting - hence these routines also provide the backend functionality for PEMtk fitting routines. Again more technical details can be found in the {{ ePSproc_docs }}."

    "The core analysis tools, which constitute the {{ PEMtk_repo }} platform, are themselves built with the aid of a range of open-source python packages/libraries which handle various backend functionality. Notably, they make use of the following key packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* General functionality makes use of the usual `Scientific Python` stack, in particular: \n",
    "   * `Numpy` for general numerical methods and data types.\n",
    "   * `pandas` for statistical methods, and various tabulation and sorting tasks.\n",
    "   * `Scipy` for some special functions and computational routines, particularly spherical harmonics and fitting routines (see below).\n",
    "* General tensor handling and manipulation makes use of the Xarray library {cite}`hoyer2017XarrayNDLabeled,XarrayDocumentation`.\n",
    "* Angular momentum functions (Wigner D and 3js) are currently implemented directly, or via the Spherical Functions library {cite}`boyle2022SphericalFunctions`, and have been tested for consistency with the definitions in Zare (for details see [the ePSproc docs](https://epsproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tests/Spherical_function_testing_Aug_2019.html) {cite}`ePSprocDocs`). The Spherical Functions library also uses `numpy_quaternion` which implements a quaternion datatype in Numpy.\n",
    "* Spherical harmonics are defined with the usual physics conventions: orthonormalised, and including the Condon-Shortley phase. Numerically they are implemented directly or via SciPy's `sph_harm` function (see [the SciPy docs for details](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.sph_harm.html) {cite}`SciPyDocumentation`. Further manipulation and conversion between different normalisations can be readily implemented with the SHtools library {cite}`wieczorek2018SHToolsToolsWorking,SHtoolsGithub`.\n",
    "* Non-linear optimization (fitting) is handled via the [lmfit library](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/index.html), which implements and/or wraps a range of non-linear fitting routines in Python {cite}`LMFITDocumentation, newville2014LMFITNonLinearLeastSquare`; for the Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization method used herein this wraps [Scipy's `least_squares` functionality](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html), which therefore constituted the core minimization routine {cite}`SciPyDocumentation` for the demonstration cases.\n",
    "* Symmetry functionality, specifically computing symmetrized harmonics $X_{hl}^{\\Gamma\\mu*}(\\theta,\\phi)$ (see {eq}`eq:AF-PAD-general`), makes use of `libmsym` {cite}`johansson2017AutomaticProcedureGeneratinga, johansson2022LibmsymGithub` (symmetry coefficients) and `SHtools` {cite}`wieczorek2018SHToolsToolsWorking,SHtoolsGithub` (general spherical harmonic handling and conversion). \n",

It is hoped that this will be a useful tool for tackling photoionization problems more generally, without \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the matrix elements for a given system.\n",
    "* Some specialist (optional) tools also make use of additional libraries, although these are not required for basic use; in particular:\n",
    "   * For 3D orbital visualizations with {{ ePSproc_repo }}: [pyvista](https://docs.pyvista.org/) for 3D plotting (which itself is built on VTK), [cclib](https://cclib.github.io/) for electronic structure file handling and conversion, and methods based on [Chemlab](https://chemlab.readthedocs.io) for molecule wavefunction (orbital) computation from electronic structure files are all used on the backend.\n",
    "   * For general plotting a range of tools are used, or can be used, including [`Matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) (basic plotting, including `Xarray` plotters), [`Holoviews`](https://holoviews.org/) (data handling and interactive plotting, wraps various backends), [`Bokeh`](https://bokeh.org/) (implemented via Holoviews), [`Plotly`](https://plotly.com/) (mainly used for spherical polar plotting), and [`Seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) (for statistical and some specialist plots).\n",
    "   * [`Numba`](https://numba.pydata.org/) is used for numerical acceleration in some routines, although remains mainly experimental in `ePSproc` at the time of writing (an exception to this is the Spherical Functions library, which does make full use of Numba acceleration).\n",
