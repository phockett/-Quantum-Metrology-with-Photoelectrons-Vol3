    "% Adapted from MFrecon article, Numerical implementation sect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, a unified Python codebase/ecosystem/platform has been in development to tackle various aspects of photoionization problems, including *ab initio* computations and experimental data handling, and (generalised) matrix element retrieval methods. The eponymous _Quantum Metrology with Photoelectrons_ platform is introduced here, and is used for the analysis herein. The main aim of the platform is to provide a unifying data platform, and analysis routines, for photoelectron metrology, including new methods and tools, as well as a unifying bridge between these and existing tools. {numref}`qm-platform-diag` provides a general overview of some of the main tools and tasks/layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of late 2022, the new parts of the platform - primarily the {{ PEMtk_repo }} library - implement general data handling (although not a full experimental analysis toolchain), matrix element handling and retrieval, which will be the main topic of this volume.\n",
    "In the future, it is hoped that the platform will be extended to other theoretical and experimental methods, including full experimental data handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "(sect:platform:analysis)=\n",
    "## Analysis components\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main components of the platform for analysis tasks, as used herein, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The {{ PEMtk_repo }} (PEMtk) codebase aims to provide various general data handling routines for photoionization problems. At the time of writing, simulation of observables and fitting routines are implemented, along with some basic utility functions.\n",
    "    Much of this is detailed herein, and more technical details and ongoing documentation case be found in the {{ PEMtk_docs }}.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The {{ ePSproc_full }} aims to provide methods for post-processing with *ab initio* radial dipole matrix\n",
    "    elements from {{ ePS_full }}, or equivalent matrix elements from other sources (dedicated support for R-matrix results from [the RMT suite](https://gitlab.com/Uk-amor/RMT/rmt) {cite}`brown2020RMTRmatrixTimedependence,RmatrixRepo` is in development). \n",
    "    The core functionality includes the computation of AF and MF observables. Manual computation without known matrix elements is also possible, e.g. for investigating\n",
    "    limiting cases, or data analysis and fitting - hence these routines also provide the backend functionality for PEMtk fitting routines. Again more technical details can be found in the {{ ePSproc_docs }}."
