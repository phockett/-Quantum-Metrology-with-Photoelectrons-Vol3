Subsections for photoionization theory

- 22/04/22 Added symmetry section, and numerical example for selection rules only.
- 22/11/22 Basics in place, needs some work and numerical examples to add.

---

% TODO: render tests. This is working in JupyterLab on Bemo (inc. \boldsymbol). NOW fixed as per below, issues with PDF builds too.

% TODO: decide on notation, and make a comment on it vs. Vol 1.

% TODO: revise text. Mostly from MF recon with some mods. May want to add some numerical examples directly here?

TODO: fix/generalise intro theory and also update notation for LF vs. MF case above, or discuss. May be better to remove some of this and just refer to Vol. 1?

Rendering issues notes (hidden cell)

Build fixed for no `\bm` case, subs as:

- \hat{\mathbf{\mu}} >> \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}

- \boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}} >> \boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}}. May only be an issue if bm loaded? Ah, yes - this is OK without bm, but get errors at `\bm` of course.

- \bm >> \boldsymbol, have this only for \bm{r} it seems, may want \mathrm here too? NEED TO LOOK CAREFULLY - can use former in general (scalar) case (or just plain r), latter in vector case.

- \mathbf{\rho} >>> \boldsymbol{\rho} (OK in HTML, not in PDF)

$$1: \hat{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}) = \hat{\mathbf{\mu}}.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}$$

$$2: \hat{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}) = \mathbf{\mu}.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}$$

$$3: \hat{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}) = \mu.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}$$

$$4: \hat{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}) = \bm{\mu}.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}$$

$$5: \hat{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}) = \boldsymbol{\mu}.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}$$

$$6: \hat{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}) = \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}$$

Without bm package, 3 - 6 are all OK. 'mathbf' seems to be an issue?  Missing fonts - renders as a '?' in a square and gives error like `! Extended mathchar used as mathchar (14799967).`?

With bm package, only 3 works (and 4 renders as $\mu0$)

$$7: \hat{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}) = \mathbf{\hat{\mu}}.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}$$

With bm package also issues with $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}$, gives `! Improper alphabetic constant`. Is $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}}$ OK? In previous vol have $\mathbf{r}$ for vector case, and plain $r$ otherwise.

# Photoionization dynamics

The core physics of photoionization has been covered extensively in the literature, and only a very brief overview is provided here with sufficient detail to introduce the metrology/reconstruction/retrieval problem; the reader is referred to Vol. 1 {cite}`hockett2018QMP1` (and refs. therein) for further details and general discussion.

% the literature listed in Appendix [\[sec:theory-lit\]](#sec:theory-lit){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:theory-lit"} for further details and general discussion.
% Technical details of the formalism applied for the reconstruction techniques discussed herein can be found in Sect. [\[sec:tensor-formulation\]](#sec:tensor-formulation){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:tensor-formulation"}.

## General forms

Photoionization can be described by the coupling of an initial state of the system to a particular final state (photoion(s) plus free photoelectron(s)), coupled by an electric field/photon. Very generically, this can be written as a matrix element $\langle\Psi_i|\hat{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}})|\Psi_f\rangle$, where $\hat{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}})$ defines the light-matter coupling operator (depending on the electric field $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}$), and $\Psi_i$, $\Psi_f$ the total wavefunctions of the initial and final states respectively.

+++

There are many flavours of this fundamental light-matter interaction, depending on system and coupling. For metrology, the focus is currently on the simplest case of single-photon absorption, in the weak field (or purturbative), dipolar regime, resulting in a single photoelectron. (For more discussion of various approximations in photoionzation, see Refs. {cite}`Seideman2002, Seideman2001`.) In this case the core physics is well defined, and tractable (albeit non-trivial), via the separation of matrix elements into radial (energy) and angular-momentum (geometric) terms pertaining to couplings between various elements of the problem; the retrieval of such matrix elements is a well-defined problem, making use of analytic terms in combination with fitting methodologies as explored herein. Again, more extensive background and discussion can be found in {{ QM1 }}, and references therein. % [TODO: Add some more refs here?]

The basic case also provides a strong foundation for extension into more complex light-matter interactions, in particular cases with shaped laser-fields (i.e. a time-dependent coupling $\hat{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E,t}})$) and multi-photon processes (which require multiple matrix elements, and/or different approximations). Note, however, that non-perturbative (strong field) light-matter interactions are, typically, not amenable to description in a separable picture in this manner. In such cases the laser field, molecular and continuum properties are strongly coupled, and are typically treated numerically in a fully time-dependent manner (although some separation of terms may work in some cases, depending on the system and interaction(s) at hand).

Underlying the photoelecton observables is the photoelectron continuum state $\left|\mathbf{k}\right>$, prepared via photoionization. The photoelectron momentum vector is denoted generally by
$\boldsymbol{\mathbf{k}}=k\mathbf{\hat{k}}$, in the molecular frame ({{ MF }}). The ionization matrix elements associated with this transition provide the set of quantum amplitudes completely defining the final continuum scattering state,

$$\left|\Psi_f\right> = \sum{\int{\left|\Psi_{+};\bf{k}\right>\left<\Psi_{+};\mathbf{k}|\Psi_f\right> d\bf{k}}},
$$ (eq:continuum-state-vec)

where the sum is over states of the molecular ion $\left|\Psi_{+}\right>$. The number of ionic states accessed depends on the nature of the ionizing pulse and interaction. For the dipolar case,

$$\hat{\Gamma}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}) = \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}$$ (eq:def-dipole-operator)

+++

Hence,

$$\left<\Psi_{+};\mathbf{k}|\Psi_f\right> =\langle\Psi_{+};\,\mathbf{k}|\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}|\Psi_{i}\rangle
$$ (eq:matE-dipole)

Where the notation implies a perturbative photoionization event from an initial state $i$ to a particular ion plus electron state following absorption of a photon $h\nu$, $|\Psi_{i}\rangle+h\nu{\rightarrow}|\Psi_{+};\boldsymbol{\mathbf{k}}\rangle$, and $\hat{\mu}.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}$ is the usual dipole interaction term {cite}`qOptics`, which includes a sum over all electrons $s$ defined in position space as $\mathbf{r_{s}}$:

$$\hat{\mu}=-e\sum_{s}\mathbf{r_{s}}
$$ (eq:dipole-operator)

+++

The position space photoelectron wavefunction is typically expressed in
the "partial wave" basis, expanded as (asymptotic) continuum
eignstates of orbital angular momentum, with angular momentum components
$(l,m)$ (note lower case notation for the partial wave components, distinct from upper-case for the similar terms $(L,M)$ in the observables),

$$\Psi_\mathbf{k}(\boldsymbol{r})\equiv\left<\boldsymbol{r}|\mathbf{k}\right> = \sum_{lm}Y_{lm}(\mathbf{\hat{k}})\psi_{lm}(\boldsymbol{r},k)
$$ (eq:elwf)

where $\boldsymbol{r}$ are MF electronic coordinates and
$Y_{lm}(\mathbf{\hat{k}})$ are the spherical harmonics.

Similarly, the ionization dipole matrix elements can be separated
generally into radial (energy-dependent or 'dynamical' terms) and
geometric (angular momentum) parts (this separation is essentially the
Wigner-Eckart Theorem, see Ref. {cite}`zareAngMom` for general discussion),
and written generally as (using notation similar to {cite}`Reid1991`):

$$\langle\Psi_{+};\,\mathbf{k}|\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}|\Psi_{i}\rangle = \sum_{lm}\gamma_{l,m}\mathbf{r}_{k,l,m}
$$ (eq:r-kllam)

+++

Provided that the geometric part of the matrix elements $\gamma_{l,m}$ -
which includes the geometric rotations into the LF arising from the dot
product in Eq.Â {eq}`eq:r-kllam` and other angular-momentum coupling terms - are
know, knowledge of the so-called radial (or reduced) dipole matrix
elements, at a given $k$ thus equates to a full description of the
system dynamics (and, hence, the observables).

For the simplest treatment, the radial matrix element can be
approximated as a 1-electron integral involving the initial electronic
state (orbital), and final continuum photoelectron wavefunction:

$$\mathbf{r}_{k,l,m}=\int\psi_{lm}(\boldsymbol{r},k)\boldsymbol{r}\Psi_{i}(\boldsymbol{r})d\boldsymbol{r}
$$ (eq:r-kllam-integral)

+++

% TODO: fix refs below

As noted above, the geometric terms $\gamma_{l,m}$ are analytical
functions which can be computed for a given case - minimally requiring
knowledge of the molecular symmetry and polarization geometry, although
other factors may also play a role (see {numref}`Sect. %s <sec:full-tensor-expansion>` for details).

% TODO: add some numerical examples here?
% TODO: general form to link to BLM expansion.

The photoelectron angular distribution (PAD) at a given $(\epsilon,t)$
can then be determined by the squared projection of
$\left|\Psi_f\right>$ onto a specific state
$\left|\Psi_{+};\bf{k}\right>$; very generally this can be written in terms of the energy and angle-resolved observable, which arises as the coherent square:

$$
I(\epsilon,\theta,\phi)=\langle\Psi_{f}|\Psi_{f}\rangle
$$ (eq:matE-sq-general)

Expansion in terms of the components of the matrix elements as detailed above then yields a separation into radial and angular components (see {{ QM1 }}, Sect. 2.1 for a full derivation), which can be written (at a single energy) as (following Eq. 2.45 of {{ QM1 }}):

$$
I(\theta,\phi;\,k)=\sum_{ll'}\sum_{\lambda\lambda'}\sum_{mm'}\gamma_{\alpha\alpha_{+}l\lambda ml'\lambda'm'}\boldsymbol{r}_{kl\lambda}\boldsymbol{r}_{kl'\lambda'}e^{i(\eta_{l\lambda}(k)-\eta_{l'\lambda'}(k))}Y_{lm}(\hat{k})Y_{l'm'}^{*}(\hat{k})
$$ (eq:I-reduced-LF-2_45-vol1)

% TODO: fix/generalise this, also update notation for LF vs. MF case above, or discuss. May be better to remove some of this and just refer to Vol. 1?

In this form $\alpha$ denotes all other quantum numbers required to define the initial state, and $\alpha_{+}$ the final state of the molecular ion. The radial matrix elements $\boldsymbol{r}_{kl\lambda}$, denote an integral over the radial part of the wavefunctions, in this case labelled by the {{ MF }} quantum numbers, and the associated scattering phase is given by $\eta_{l\lambda}(k)$ (i.e. the matrix elements are written in magnitude-phase form, rather than complex form).The $\gamma$ terms denotes a general set of geometric paramters arising from the coherent square.  A tensor form is also given herein, see {numref}`Sect. %s <sec:full-tensor-expansion>`, including a full breakdown of these terms and numerical implementation. Comparison with Eq. {eq}`eq:AF-PAD-general` then indicates that the amplitudes
in Eq.Â {eq}`eq:r-kllam` also determine the observable anisotropy
parameters $\beta_{L,M}(\epsilon,t)$ (Eqn.
{eq}`eq:AF-PAD-general`), which basically collect all the terms in Eq. {eq}`eq:I-reduced-LF-2_45-vol1` and the product over spherical harmonics, into a result set of $(L,M)$. (Note that the photoelectron energy
$\epsilon$ and momentum $k$ are used somewhat interchangeably herein,
with the former usually preferred in reference to observables.) 

Note, also, that in the treatment above there is no time-dependence
incorporated in the notation; however, a time-dependent treatment
readily follows, and may be incorporated either as explicit
time-dependent modulations in the expansion of the wavefunctions for a
given case, or implicitly in the radial matrix elements. Examples of the
former include, e.g. a rotational or vibrational wavepacket, or a
time-dependent laser field. The rotational wavepacket case is discussed
herein (see {numref}`Sect. %s <sec:full-tensor-expansion>`). The radial matrix elements are
a sensitive function of molecular geometry and electronic configuration
in general, hence may be considered to be responsive to molecular
dynamics, although they are formally time-independent in a
Born-Oppenheimer basis - for further general discussion and examples see
Ref. {cite}`wu2011TimeresolvedPhotoelectronSpectroscopy` and {{ QM1 }}; discussions of more
complex cases with electronic and nuclear dynamics can be found in Refs.
{cite}`arasaki2000ProbingWavepacketDynamics,Seideman2001,Suzuki2001,Stolow2008`.



Typically, for reconstruction experiments, a given measurement will be
selected to simplify this as much as possible by, e.g., populating only
a single ionic state (or states for which the corresponding observables
are experimentally energetically-resolvable), and with a bandwidth
$d\bf{k}$ which is small enough such that the matrix elements can be
assumed constant over the observation window. Importantly, the angle-resolved observables are
sensitive to the magnitudes and (relative) phases of these matrix
elements - as emphasised in the magnitude-phase form of Eq. {eq}`eq:I-reduced-LF-2_45-vol1` - and can be considered as angular interferograms.

+++

% TODO: explicitly write out general form and discuss a bit further, inc. link to observables and tensor form later.
% 30/11/22 Added general form as per eq. 2.45 in QM1, but may want to modify a bit, esp. LF vs. AF notation to match channel funcs later.

## Symmetry in photoionization

Symmetry in photoionization has briefly been suggested by the introduction of symmetrized harmonics ({numref}`Sect. %s <sec:theory:sym-harm-into>`), and is discussed in detail in {{ QM1 }} (Sect. 2.2.3.3). Herein a brief review is given, with a focus on using symmetry in matrix element retrieval problems. For further details, see {{ QM1 }}; for a more general discussion of symmetry in molecular spectroscopy see the textbook by  Bunker and Jensen {cite}`bunkerMolSymm`, and the specific case of photoionization is expanded on in the work of Signorell and Merkt {cite}`Signorell1997`. 


+++

In general, for the dipole matrix element to be non-zero the direct product of the initial state, final state and dipole operator symmetries must contain the totally symmetric representation of the molecular symmetry ({{ MS }}) group, which is isomorphic to the point group ({{ PG }}) in rigid molecules. This general case can be written as:

$$
\Gamma_{rve}^{f}\otimes\Gamma_{dipole}\otimes\Gamma_{rve}^{i}\supset\Gamma^{s}
$$ (eq:rovib-selection-symm)

Where $\Gamma_{rve}$ is the rovibronic symmetry of the system (i.e. total symmetry excluding spin), with the $i/f$ superscript denoting
initial and final states respectively. $\Gamma^{s}$ is the totally symmetric representation in the appropriate molecular symmetry group,
and $\Gamma_{dipole}$ is the symmetry of the dipole operator.

For the specific case of photoionization the final state is split into the symmetry species of the ion and the photoelectron {cite}`Signorell1997`:

$$
\Gamma^{e}\otimes\Gamma_{rve}^{+}\otimes\Gamma_{dipole}\otimes\Gamma_{rve}^{i}\supset\Gamma^{s}
$$ (eq:ionization-symm)

This is, essentially, a statement of the limiting case of Eq. {eq}`eq:matE-dipole` (see also alternative forms of Eqs. {eq}`eq:r-kllam`, {eq}`eq:r-kllam-integral`), which defines the symmetry requirements for the overlap integral to be non-zero (although does not indicate that it will be non-zero for a given system).

In the reconstruction experiments discussed herein, this general form can be often be further simplified. In particular, assuming a full Born-Oppenheimer separation of dynamics, the problem can be treated within the static {{ PG }} of the system, and only the electronic state symmetries need to be taken into account. In practice, this treatment is appropriate for cases with separable rotational wavepackets, and may also be a reasonable approximation for cases with vibronic wavepackets in cases where the nuclear excursions are relatively small and/or can be treated as linear combinations over a set of symmetrized basis functions. Within this approximation the general symmetry requirements can be written as:

$$
\Gamma^{e(X)}\otimes\Gamma_{e}^{+}\otimes\Gamma_{dipole}\otimes\Gamma_{e}^{i}\supset\Gamma^{s}
$$ (eq:ionization-symm-electronic)

And $\Gamma^{e(X)}$ indicates that the continuum symmetries are expressed in a basis of symmetrized harmonics ({numref}`Sect. %s <sec:theory:sym-harm-into>`). From Eq. {eq}`eq:ionization-symm-electronic`, the set of allowed matrix elements for a given ionization event can be expressed, in terms of the allowed set of symmetrized harmonics $X_{hl}^{\Gamma\mu*}(\theta,\phi)$, or (equivalently) the usual partial wave basis expressed in spherical harmonics $Y_{l,\lambda}(\theta,\phi)$, and a set of associated symmetrization coefficients $b_{hl\lambda}^{\Gamma\mu}$.

A brief numerical example is given below, and a more detailed treatment for a range of photoionization cases in **PART II**.
