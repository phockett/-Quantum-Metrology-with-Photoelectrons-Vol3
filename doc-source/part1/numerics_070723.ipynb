    "Following the tensor notation outline in {numref}`Sect. %s <sec:tensor-formulation>`, the complete quantum metrology of a photoionization event (a.k.a. a \"complete\" photoionization experiment) can be characterized as recovery of the matrix elements $I^{\\zeta}(\\epsilon)$ (per Eqs. {eq}`eqn:channel-fns`, {eq}`eqn:I-zeta`) from the experimental measurements or, equivalently, the density matrix $\\mathbf{\\rho}^{\\zeta\\zeta'}$ (Eqs. {eq}`eqn:full-density-mat` - {eq}`eqn:beta-density-mat`). In general, such a recovery or reconstruction may be possible provided the {{ GAMMACHANNEL }} are known, and the information content of the measurements is sufficient; it is, however, also possible that restrictions in any given case may preclude reconstruction, or restrict the level of recovery possible (e.g. to a lower symmetry group, or certain subsets of {{ RADMATE }}) or fidelity of such a reconstruction. (For further discussion and background, see Refs. {cite}`Reid2003,kleinpoppen2013perfect` and {{ QM1 }}.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of particular import for {{ RADMATE }} retrieval is the phase-sensitive nature of the observables ({numref}`Sect. %s <sect:theory:observables>`), which is required in order to obtain phase information on the {{ PARTIALWAVES }}. In this context, {{ PADs }} can also be considered as *angular interferograms*, and reconstruction can be considered conceptually similar to other phase-retrieval problems, e.g. optical field recovery with techniques such as FROG {cite}`trebino2000FrequencyResolvedOpticalGating`, and general quantum tomography {cite}`MauroDAriano2003`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As introduced previously ({numref}`Sect. %s <sec:main-intro:bootstrapping>`), the focus herein is the development and testing of the *generalised {{ BOOTSTRAP }}*, based on time-resolved {{ RWP }} photoionization experiments. A general outline of the simplest 2-stage version of this protocol is shown in {numref}`fig-bootstrap-fitting-diag`. In this scheme, the {{ GAMMACHANNEL }} are assumed to be known, and the {{ ADMs }} assumed to be accurately computable: these are, in general, required to determine the {{ RADMATE }} in this protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "% For schemes making use of molecular alignment, or other control methods, the contribution of the control parameters to the {{ GAMMACHANNEL }} must, therefore, be accounted for. In general, these contributions may be computed and/or obtained from experiment. For the rotational wavepacket ({{ RWP }}) case, this can be considered as the requirement that the the molecular axis distributions ({{ ADMs }}) must be determined, and this is a necessary prerequisite for reconstruction of the {{ RADMATE }}. \n",
    "\n",
    "An extended outline comparing some similar approaches is shown in {numref}`fig-general-fitting-diag`; of particular note here is the possibility for retrieval directly from {{ MF }} measurements. Alternative, but conceptually similar, protocols involving different control parameters (as distinct from the {{ RWP }} and {{ MF }} cases), may also be also be used, see {{ QM12 }} for examples. For protocols making use of control methods, the key requirement is for the contribution of the control parameters to the observable, and associated coupling to the {{ GAMMACHANNEL }} to be accurately accounted for. In general, these contributions may be computed and/or obtained from experiment depending on the scheme used. One advantage of the {{ RWP }} case is that the {{ RWP }} can be accurately computed, and the determination of the corresponding molecular alignment ({{ ADMs }}) from an experiment can be treated as a reduced-dimensionality linear signal retrieval problem. As indicated in {numref}`fig-bootstrap-fitting-diag`, this stage is separable, and forms *level 1* of the {{ BOOTSTRAP }}. In this procedure sets of computed {{ ADMs }} form the basis set for the fitting (as a function of laser fluence and rotational temperature), allowing the accurate determination of the experimentally-achieved alignment; this is discussed further in {numref}`Sect. %s <sect:numerics:alignment-retrieval>`. *Level 2* involves non-linear data fitting, making use of the {{ ADMs }} and the {{ GAMMACHANNEL }}, in order to compute observables, and obtaining the {{ RADMATE }} as the fitted parameters; this is discussed further in {numref}`Sect. %s <sect:numerics:matE-retrieval>`.

    "\n",
    "In general, the extraction of parameters from a data set can be viewed as a general minimization (fitting) problem. This type of treatment is versatile, and can be multi-stage depending on the complexity of the problem. For the generalised bootstrapping method, the treatment of photoionization data is split into two types of fit, as shown in {numref}`fig-bootstrap-fitting-diag`. Firstly, a linear fitting stage to retrieve the molecular axis distribution, characterised by a set of {{ ADMs }} (see {numref}`Sect. %s <sec:theory:AF-alignment-term>` for details); secondly, a non-linear fitting stage to retrieve the complex-valued matrix elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the data, the 1st stage can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{\\beta}_{L,M}^{u}(\\epsilon,t)=\\sum_{K,Q,S}A_{Q,S}^{K}(t)\\bar{C}_{KQS}^{LM}(\\epsilon)\n",
    "$$ (eqn:beta-convolution-C)\n",
    "\n",
    "And the 2nd stage as per Eqs. {eq}`eqn:channel-fns` and {eq}`eq:BLM-tensor-AF` for the AF case:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{\\beta}_{L,M}^{u}(\\epsilon,t)=\\sum_{\\zeta,\\zeta'}\\bar{\\varUpsilon_{}}_{L,M}^{u,\\zeta\\zeta'}(t)\\mathbb{I}^{\\zeta\\zeta'}(\\epsilon)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In these forms, the terms are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $A_{Q,S}^{K}(t)$, the set of {{ ADMs }} defining the molecular alignment, and associated parameters $\\bar{C}_{KQS}^{LM}(\\epsilon)$.\n",
    "2. $\\bar{\\varUpsilon_{}}_{L,M}^{u,\\zeta\\zeta'}(t)$, the channel functions in the {{ AF }} (Eq. {eq}`eq:BLM-tensor-AF`, and matrix elements $\\mathbb{I}^{\\zeta\\zeta'}(\\epsilon)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence stage (2) relies on the inputs of stage (1), i.e. the {{ ADMs }}; and the parameters in stage (1) can be determined via fitting the data (linear regression) making use of computed sets of $A_{Q,S}^{K}(t)$ as a function of experimental parameters (laser fluence and rotational temperature). In this case, a range of {{ ADMs }} (\"basis sets\") are computed, and the best match to the experimental data chosen - more details are discussed in {numref}`Sect. %s <sect:numerics:alignment-retrieval>`. In a similar manner, the 2nd stage makes use of a known basis set - the {{ GAMMACHANNEL }} - but a non-linear fit is required to determine the set of matrix elements, see {numref}`Sect. %s <sect:numerics:matE-retrieval>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is also of note that, although the case herein focusses on rotational wavepackets as a control parameter, the same general approach can be applied to other cases, e.g. fitting {{ MF }}-{{ PADs }} directly (for which only the 2nd stage is required), fitting {{ PADs }} obtained via rotational state-resolved transitions, with shaped laser pulses and so on, as detailed in {{ QM12 }}. Although only rotational wavepacket cases are illustrated in this work (see {{ PARTII }}), by suitable choice of dataset and channel functions many other experimental schemes may be modelled and analysed; the {{ PEMtk_repo }} is designed with  this flexibility in mind."

    "Efforts to align and orient molecules in recent decades have led to detailed studies of the rotational dynamics of molecules after interaction with a non-resonant femtosecond laser pulse. A significant outcome of these studies has been the development of a reliable model capable of accurate simulations of rotational wavepacket dynamics that quantitatively agree with experimental results. By measurement of a signal from a time evolving rotational wavepacket, this ability to accurately simulate the wavepacket dynamics can be used to reconstruct the measured signal in the {{ MF }}. Since in this case the time resolved measurement constitutes a set of measurements of the same quantity from a variety of molecular axes distributions (sets of {{ ADMs }}), it is reasonable to conclude that if the axes distributions are known, and provided a large enough space of orientations is explored by the molecule over the experimental time window, the {{ MF }} signal should be extractable. \n",

However, the correspondence of the problem with an equation of the form of Eq. {eq}`eq:St-Cjk` - essentially a convolution - can be made. This is discussed in detail in Ref. {cite}`Underwood2000`. In the current case Eqs. {eq}`eqn:channel-fns` and {eq}`eq:BLM-tensor-AF` can be rewritten in a similar form to Eq. {eq}`eq:St-Cjk` by explicitly separating out the {{ ADMs }} $A_{Q,S}^{K}(t)$ and collapsing all other terms. The case of photoionization from a time-dependent ensemble can then be reparameterized as indicated in Eq. {eq}`eqn:beta-convolution-C`. Here the set of axis distribution moments can thus be viewed as modulating all observables $\\beta_{L,M}^{u}(t)$. The unknowns, $\\bar{C}_{KQS}^{LM}$ and axis distribution moments $A_{Q,S}^{K}(t)$, can be retrieved in a similar manner to that discussed for the simpler scalar observable case above (Eq. {eq}`eq:St-Cjk`), i.e. via linear regression with {{ RWP }}. \n",

The closest set of parameters to the experimental case is then determined by selection of the best results (smallest uncertainty) from such a parameter-space mapping, which constitutes determination of both the rotational wavepacket (hence $A_{Q,S}^{K}(t)$) and $\\bar{C}_{KQS}^{LM}(\\epsilon)$. Optimally, the corresponding physical properties can be cross-checked with other experimental estimates for additional confirmation of the fidelity of the protocol, although this may not always be possible.

    "The overall approach to complex non-linear fitting incorporates a number of aspects, broadly \"fitting strategies\", which may influence the likelyhood of a successful {{ RADMATE }} retrieval, and/or the time required to achieve this result:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The choice of numerical fitting method ({numref}`Sect. %s <sect:numerics:implementation-details>`).\n",
    "2. The choice of dataset to analyse (and/or the choice of experimental measurement).\n",
    "3. Additional statistical and/or other meta-analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing, work is ongoing in all these areas, and the illustrations in {{ PARTII }} herein include further notes regarding limitations or expectations for specific cases. Clearly, there are many choices numerically, and detailed investigation is required to determine the optimal strategy in any given case (this is examined partially in {{ PARTII }} in terms of limiting cases by symmetry). Emerging data analysis methods may also be useful here, in particular GPU-based routines and specialist high-dimensional space fitting methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect that is intrinsic to these examples, but has not been discussed elsewhere, is the meta-analysis of the retrieved {{ RADMATE }}. This is discussed generally in {{ QM2 }} Sect. 8.2.2, and implemented numerically in the examples in {{ PARTII}} herein. The general aim in this type of analysis is to ascertain whether a given set of retrieved parameters is accurate and unique in a given case. Naturally, for test cases with synthetic data (as in {{ PARTII }}), testing against the known input {{ RADMATE }} is the best solution and provides the most stringent test for the applicability of the retrieval method - but this is, of course, not generally useful for experimental datasets. Instead, as per previous analysis cases (see {{ QM2 }}), a statistical (or \"numerical experiment\") approach can be used. In this type of approach, a number of fits $n$ (typically on the order of $10^2$-$10^4$) are run independently, with different seed parameters and/or different input data (cf. Monte Carlo methods, and statistical bootstrap methods), and the set of results analysed for consistency and uniqueness over the retrieved parameter sets. As outined in {{ QM2 }} (updated to match the notation herein), \"Each fit yields a solution set $\\mathbb{I}^{\\zeta\\zeta'}(n)$, with a final value of $\\chi^{2}(\\mathbb{I}^{\\zeta\\zeta'}(n))$. Analysis of the fitted parameters $\\chi^{2}(\\mathbb{I}^{\\zeta\\zeta'})$ can be employed to probe the behaviour of the fitting algorithm, and also to gain information on how well the experimental data defines each fitted parameter. Although it is non-trivial to visualize the full $\\chi^{2}$ hypersurface, aspects can be probed by plotting histograms and correlation plots of the fitted parameters. A large scatter in the value of a given fit parameter over a range of fits to the same data suggests a poorly defined parameter; a consistent result meanwhile shows that a particular parameter is well defined by the dataset. The experimental data can show different sensitivities to different parameters depending on the type of ionizing transitions present, because different transitions will (according to the magnitude of the geometrical parameters and symmetry constraints [i.e. {{ GAMMACHANNEL }} herein]) be more sensitive to certain partial-waves. Additionally, the presence of multiple minima in the fit may be revealed by the presence of more than one feature in the histogram, reflecting more than one \"best\" fit result, while correlations appearing between supposedly uncorrelated parameters can indicate emergent behaviours in the high-dimensional space or - more prosaically - issues with the fitting methodology or coding.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The same approach is taken in the case-studies of {{ PARTII }}, which include statistical analysis to determine the \"correct\" {{ RADMATE }} from a set of non-linear fits, and associated uncertainties, again with the hope of illustrating general methods.\n",
