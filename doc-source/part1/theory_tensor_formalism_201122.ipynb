Furthermore, the tensors can readily be converted to a density matrix representation {cite}`BlumDensityMat,zareAngMom`, which is more natural for some quantities, and also emphasizes the link to quantum state tomography and other quantum information techniques.

The {{ PEMtk_repo }} codebase implements matrix element retrieval based on the tensor formalism, with pre-computation of all the geometric tensor components (channel functions) prior to a fitting protocol for matrix element analysis, essentially a fit to Eqn. {eq}`eqn:channel-fns`, with terms $I^{\\zeta}(\\epsilon)$ as the unknowns (in magnitude, phase form per {eq}`eqn:I-zeta-mag-phase`). The main computational cost of a tensor-based approach is that more RAM is required to store the full set of tensor variables; however, the method is computationally efficient since it is inherently parallel (as compared to a traditional, serial loop-based solution), hence may lead to significantly faster evaluation of observables.
