# About the authors

## Paul Hockett

Paul's interests span a gamut of topics in atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) and quantum physics, at the intersection of spectroscopy, photoionization, (ultrafast) optics, dynamics, and metrology. Recent work has focussed on photoelectron metrology, with the main aims of matrix element retrieval, as outlined in this series (*Quantum metrology with photoelectron*) of books. Paul is a research scientist at the National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Canada.


## Varun Makhija

Varun's interests span a gamut of topics in atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) and quantum physics, at the intersection of spectroscopy, photoionization, (ultrafast) optics, dynamics and metrology. Recent work has focussed on rotational wavepacket methodologies and reconstruction, and application of these techniques to molecular systems, including full excited state density matrix reconstruction. Varun is a faculty member at the University of Mary Washington, Virginia, USA.
