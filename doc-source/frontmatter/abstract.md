# Abstract

The overall aim of Quantum Metrology with Photoelectrons Vol. 3 is to expand, explore, and illustrate, new computational developments in quantum metrology with photoelectrons: specifically, the application of new python-based tools to tackle problems in matrix element retrieval. Part I details the topic, theory and computational methods; Part II provides further numerical details and case-studies.

The book itself is fully open-source, and written as a set of Jupyter Notebooks. All the material herein is available directly to readers via a Github repository {{ book_repo }}. Any example script, page, chapter - up to and including the full book - can be executed and modified by readers to further explore the topic interactively, and provide a foundation which can be adapted to apply the methodology to new problems. Further details can be found in {numref}`Sect. %s <sec:intro-context>`.
