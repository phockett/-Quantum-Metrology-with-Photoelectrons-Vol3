In general use these are not required, but will transparently display figures when executed in the Jupyter Lab environment. Note that glued tables from `Pandas` DataFrames are not nicely rendered in the HTML format, but interactive HTML output is usually include too, although this may be hidden in the cell above the glued table.\n",
