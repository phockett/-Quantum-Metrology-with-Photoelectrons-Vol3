# A note on book versions, formats and conventions

This book exists in multiple formats, which are not all equal:

1. Jupyter notebooks. The original form, interactive computational notebooks includes text, executable code and full outputs. Source notebooks are available via {{ book_repo }}.

2. HTML pages. Compiled from the notebooks, include interactive figures and most computational outputs. The HTML version is available at {{ book_HTML }}.

3. PDF and hard-copy. Standard static outputs, compiled from the notebooks. In this form some computational outputs are truncated or omitted for brevity and readability. Since some formats may not support hyperlinks, URLs to external references are also generally included in the bibliography - note that these may not always be the *full* URLs linked in the main text, and may only list the main index page of a given site in some cases.

For more details on the aims, tools and build-chain, see {numref}`Sect. %s <sec:intro-technical-notes>`.

In many cases where there is significant truncation of the presentation in the PDF, a note like this may be included.
