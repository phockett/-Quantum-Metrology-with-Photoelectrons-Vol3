# About the authors


Paul Hockett and Varun Makhija's interests span a gamut of topics in atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) and quantum physics, at the intersection of spectroscopy, photoionization, (ultrafast) optics, molecular control and dynamics, and metrology. Paul's recent work has focussed on photoelectron metrology, with the main aims of matrix element retrieval, as outlined in this series (*Quantum metrology with photoelectron*) of books. Varun's work has focussed primarily on rotational wavepacket methodologies and reconstruction, and application of these techniques to molecular systems, including full excited state density matrix reconstruction and applications in photoelectron metrology.
