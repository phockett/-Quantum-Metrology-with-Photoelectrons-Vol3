    "There are many flavours of this fundamental light-matter interaction, depending on system and coupling. For metrology, the focus is currently on the simplest case of single-photon absorption, in the weak field (or purturbative), dipolar regime, resulting in a single photoelectron. (For more discussion of various approximations in photoionzation, see Refs. {cite}`Seideman2002, Seideman2001`.) In this case the core physics is well defined, and tractable (albeit non-trivial), via the separation of matrix elements into radial (energy) and angular-momentum (geometric) terms pertaining to couplings between various elements of the problem; the retrieval of such matrix elements is a well-defined problem, making use of analytic terms in combination with fitting methodologies as explored herein. Again, more extensive background and discussion can be found in {{ QM1 }}, and references therein. % [TODO: Add some more refs here?]\n",

Note, however, that non-perturbative (strong field) light-matter interactions are, typically, not amenable to description in a separable picture in this manner. In such cases the laser field, molecular and continuum properties are strongly coupled, and are typically treated numerically in a fully time-dependent manner (although some separation of terms may work in some cases, depending on the system and interaction(s) at hand).\n",
